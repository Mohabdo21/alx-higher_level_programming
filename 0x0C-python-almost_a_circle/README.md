0x0C. Python - Almost a Circle
===============================

This project is a part of the Alx - SE curriculum in software engineering. The primary goal is to delve into Python concepts and implement a class that nearly emulates a circle.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

-   Understand the significance of unit testing in large-scale projects.
-   Implement unit testing strategies for ensuring code reliability and quality.
-   Learn how to serialize and deserialize a Class in Python.
-   Understand the process of working with JSON files in Python.
-   Master the usage of *args and **kwargs in Python functions.
-   Learn effective ways to handle named arguments within functions.

Unit Testing in Large Projects
-------------------------------

Unit testing plays a pivotal role in verifying the functionality of individual units of code. In a large project, it becomes indispensable to ensure that each component behaves as expected, helping maintain code quality and identify potential bugs or errors early in the development cycle. This project explores different strategies and practices for implementing robust unit tests.

Serialization and Deserialization of a Class
-------------------------------------------

Serialization involves converting a Python object into a format that can be stored or transmitted, such as JSON, while deserialization refers to reconstructing the object from the serialized data. This project delves into the techniques used for serialization and deserialization of a Class, showcasing how data can be transformed for storage or transmission and retrieved back into its original form.

Working with JSON Files
------------------------

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular format for storing and exchanging data. This project covers the fundamental aspects of writing and reading JSON files in Python, providing insights into storing structured data and retrieving it effectively.

Understanding *args and **kwargs
--------------------------------

*args and **kwargs are powerful tools in Python for handling variable-length arguments within functions. This project explores their usage, demonstrating how they can be employed to accept an arbitrary number of positional and keyword arguments, respectively, offering flexibility in function definitions.

Handling Named Arguments in Functions
-------------------------------------

Named arguments bring clarity and readability to function calls by explicitly assigning values to specific parameters. This project demonstrates effective ways to manage named arguments within functions, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
