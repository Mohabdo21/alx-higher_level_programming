0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
====================================================

This project is part of the Alx - SE curriculum of software engineering. It focuses on understanding and implementing more data structures in Python, specifically sets and dictionaries.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

-   Sets are unordered collections of unique, hashable elements. They can be defined using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function.
-   Common set methods include `add()`, `remove()`, `union()`, and `intersection()`.
-   Sets are used for storing unique elements without caring about their order, while lists are used when order matters or elements may not be unique.
-   Sets can be iterated over using a for loop.
-   Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs, defined using curly braces `{}` with keys and values separated by a colon `:`.
-   Dictionaries are used when you want to associate values with keys for efficient lookup.
-   A key in a dictionary is a unique identifier used to look up a value.
-   Dictionaries can be iterated over using the `.keys()`, `.values()`, and `.items()` methods.
-   A lambda function is a small anonymous function that takes any number of arguments but has only one expression.
-   The `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions operate on lists (and other iterable objects). They apply a function to all items in a list, create a list of elements for which a function returns true, and reduce the list to a single output by applying a function of two arguments cumulatively, respectively.
